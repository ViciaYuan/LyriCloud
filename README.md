# Lyricloud
Use python to crawl lyrics automatically from a whole playlist at [NetEase](https://music.163.com/) , and use [WordArt](https://wordart.com/)  to generate lyric cloud.

Thank [WangYang-wy](https://github.com/WangYang-wy) for his commits and great support~

### version 2 files
* **/cloud_img** : store LyriCloud imags. (just for demonstration)
+ **/lyrics** : store lyric txt files of each album. (not so necessary)
- **lyrics_crawl.py** : use album_id as input, then you get the all the lyrics from that album for output.
* **get_songid.py** : how to get song_ids from album_id.

### next step
offer more options of playlists:
* from album using album_id (finished)
+ from a singer's top 50 hit songs using singer_id
- from a playlist created by users using playlist_id
* to be continued...
